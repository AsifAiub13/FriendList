# FriendList

Instruction:
Clone the project and Just open FriendList.xcodeproj file using Xcode.
No third party framework has been used in this project.

I have used MVVM architecture.

API Details:
I have chosen the https://randomuser.me API.
This API returns a number of random users information like name, gender, country etc.
As the requirement was to use an API that will allow to input a minimum of two search parameters, I have used the Gender property and Searching using Name/Country.

Thanks.
